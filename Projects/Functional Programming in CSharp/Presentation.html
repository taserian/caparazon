# Functional Programming in C#

# What we'll cover

1. Functional Programming: What is it?
2. Side effects
3. Expressions over statements
4. Functions as data
5. Quick example (side effects, expressions)

# Functional Programming: What is it?

A programming paradigm which concentrates on computing results rather than on performing actions.

- Controlling side effects
- Using expressions instead of statements
- Treating functions as data 

Functional programming resurgence ( inputs => output )

Memoization.

> Object-Oriented Programming makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts.
> Functional Programming makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts.
> .right[Michael Feathers]

???
Reducing side effects 

Optimization close to the machine in early years of computing, compared to functional programming.

Now we're running into problems with programming in parallel to make use of multiple cores,
 and the worries about optimization are not as prioritized.

Functional programming makes extensive use of garbage collection, and memoization.

---
# Side effects

Method calls that change shared state can cause unpredictability.

Even if you want the side effects, it makes reasoning about that function more difficult. 

Makes it harder to test a function.

???
GetOrderItems which removed items from inventory, causing a discount to be calculated incorrectly.

It's no longer a matter of getting a result from a function call, but also reasoning about how
it affects the system state.

Testing now requires you to consider the state outside the function and not only the function's
input parameters.

---
# Side effects

Pure functions only operate with the input provided.

Impure functions involve dealing with some state from outside the function.
- Database 
- Input/Output

C# is not functional, but can be used in a functional manner.

Immutability
- turns away from side effects
- enforces the separation between data and behavior.

---
# Expressions over statements

In functional languages, everything produces a result. (No void functions)

Statements define actions, and are executed for their side effects.

Expressions produce results, and are executed for their result.

```cs
        // Statement
        string posOrNeg;

        if (value > 0) 
            posOrNeg = "positive";
        else
            posOrNeg = "negative";    

        // Functional    
        var posOrNeg =
            (value > 0) 
                ? "positive"
                : "negative"
```
???
Expression composition
---
# Expressions over statements

Expression composition:

```cs
        // Statement
        string posOrNeg;

        if (value > 0) 
            posOrNeg = "positive";
        else
            posOrNeg = "negative";   

        var msg = $"{value} is {posOrNeg}"

        // Functional    
        var msg = $"{value} is {((value > 0) ? "positive" : "negative")}";
```
---
# Functions as data

Higher-order functions

You're probably already using this as LINQ.

Lambda functions!

???
Higher order functions are

Functions which accept other functions as parameters.

Functions which return other functions.

---
# Functions as data

```cs
    // Imperative    
    var ix = 0
    while (ix < myList.Count)
    {
        if (myList[ix] % 2 != 0)
        {
            myList.RemoveAt(ix);
        }
        else
        {
            ++ix;
        }
    }

    myList.Sort();

    // Functional
    myList
        .Where(x => x % 2 == 0)
        .OrderBy(x => x);

```
???
Something inside the loop must cause the loop condition to be false.

Both the variable and the list change.

Is that variable used somewhere else?

Editing the list within the function could cause system-wide changes.

Sort is a void method, so it's run for its side effects, not for its result.

We don't care how the Where clause iterates over the list, as long as it guarantees to do so.

Also, these LINQ methods do not change the original list.

# Quick example

```cs
    public class NumberRange
    {
        public int lowerBound { get; set; }
        public int upperBound { get; set; }

        public bool InRange(int check)
        {
            return (lowerbound <= check && upperBound >= check);
        }
    }

    var testValues = new List<int>{ 3, 7, 15, 30}
    
    var range = new NumberRange { lowerBound = 0, upperBound = 20 }
    
    testValues.ForEach(d => Console.Log($"{d} - {(range.InRange(d)}")));

*   range.lowerBound = 10;
    
    testValues.ForEach(d => Console.Log($"{d} - {(range.InRange(d)}")));
```
???
Issues:

No constructor. No way to enforce rules, like making sure that 
upperBound is larger than lowerBound.

Range has changed its value, which is a code smell in functional programming.

You may behave and use it properly, but someone else may not.

# Quick example

```cs
    public class NumberRange
    {
        public int lowerBound { get; private set; }
        public int upperBound { get; private set; }
*        public DateRange(int lower, int upper) {
*            if (upper < lower) throw new Exception("Bad doggy.")
*            lowerBound = lower;
*            upperBound = upper;
*        }
        public bool InRange(int check) {
            return (lowerbound <= check && upperBound >= check);
        }
    }

    var testValues = new List<int>{ 3, 7, 1, 10}
    var range1 = new NumberRange(0, 20);
    testValues.ForEach(d => Console.Log($"{d} - {(range1.InRange(d)}")));
*   var range2 = new NumberRange(10, 20);
*   testValues.ForEach(d => Console.Log($"{d} - {(range2.InRange(d)}")));
```
???
Issues:

Added a constructor, and removed the ability to use set on a new NumberRange.

Now instead of modifying the range, we create a new one.

Let's add a Slide capability.

# Quick example

```cs
    public class NumberRange
    {
        public int lowerBound { get; private set; }
        public int upperBound { get; private set; }
        public DateRange(int lower, int upper) {
            if (upper < lower) throw new Exception("Bad doggy.")
            lowerBound = lower;
            upperBound = upper;
        }
        public bool InRange(int check) {
            return (lowerbound <= check && upperBound >= check);
        }
*        public void Slide(int amount){
*            lowerBound += amount;
*            upperBound += amount;
*        }
    }

    var testValues = new List<int>{ 3, 7, 1, 10}
    var range1 = new NumberRange(0, 20);
    testValues.ForEach(d => Console.Log($"{d} - {(range1.InRange(d)}")));
    var range2 = new NumberRange(10, 20);
    testValues.ForEach(d => Console.Log($"{d} - {(range2.InRange(d)}")));
*   range1.Slide(5);
*   testValues.ForEach(d => Console.Log($"{d} - {(range1.InRange(d)}")));
```
???
Issues:

If we add it like this, we're letting the class do something that we're not 
allowed to do ourselves.

# Quick example

```cs
    public class NumberRange
    {
        public int lowerBound { get; }
        public int upperBound { get; }
        public DateRange(int lower, int upper) {
            if (upper < lower) throw new Exception("Bad doggy.")
            lowerBound = lower;
            upperBound = upper;
        }
        public bool InRange(int check) {
            return (lowerbound <= check && upperBound >= check);
        }
*        public NumberRange Slide(int amount){
*            return new NumberRange(lowerBound + amount, upperBound + amount);
*        }
    }

    var testValues = new List<int>{ 3, 7, 1, 10}
    var range1 = new NumberRange(0, 20);
    testValues.ForEach(d => Console.Log($"{d} - {(range1.InRange(d)}")));
    var range2 = new NumberRange(10, 20);
    testValues.ForEach(d => Console.Log($"{d} - {(range2.InRange(d)}")));
*   var range3 = range1.Slide(5);
    testValues.ForEach(d => Console.Log($"{d} - {(range3.InRange(d)}")));
```
???
Issues:

C# won't tell you that an expression used as a astatement will just be discarded.
